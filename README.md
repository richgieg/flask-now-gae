#Flask-Now
**Use this starter-kit to quickly create Bootstrap-enabled Flask web
applications that have built-in user management, email functionality,
and that run on Google's App Engine.**

This is a port of my [Flask-Now][1] project. It has been modified to
run on Google's App Engine framework and NDB datastore.
More info to come... stay tuned!

This project utilizes the following Flask extensions:

- Flask-Login
- Flask-Bootstrap
- Flask-WTF
- Flask-Moment
